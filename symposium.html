            <h2>About</h2>
            <hr>
            <p class="text">
              A two-day research symposium on cloud physics by and for early-career researchers. This event grew out of a simple observation from our own PhD experience: research groups across the UK don’t often have the opportunity to engage with one another’s work. We thought: why not get everyone together and change that?
            </p>
            <p class="text">
              The event starts at midday on the Thursday and will finish by 1 PM the following day. Lunch on both days will be provided, as will dinner on the Thursday. Since our aim is building community, there will be plenty of time for discussions, and we are inviting all participants to give a talk and bring a small poster.
            </p>
            <p class="text">
               We welcome contributions across all aspects of cloud physics. That means research topics at all scales, from cloud and aerosol microphysics to global and climate scale interactions. And approaches can include observations, modelling and machine and deep learning or research tools development.
            </p>
            <!-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------->
            <h2>Submitting your research</h2>
            <hr>
            <p class="text">
              Participants are invited to submit an A3 size poster (landscape preferred) on their research. These will be printed by us and presented at the event. The posters will also be published on the group website to help show off your research and interests to members of the community unable to attend in person. In addition, participants are invited to give a lightning talk advertising their poster and research. These contributions must be submitted virtually by 9 AM on Wednesday, the 18th March, details on how to submit these will be shared closer to the date.
            </p>

              <strong>When?</strong> 19-20 March 2026, from 12 PM Thursday the 19th, to 1 PM Friday the 20th.
            </p>
            <p class="text">
              <strong>Where?</strong> Department of Physics, University of Oxford, Oxford, UK.
            </p>
            <p class="text">
              <strong>What?</strong> keynote talks, lighning research talks from all participants, networking and more.
            </p>
            <p class="text">
              <strong>Am I studying cloud physics?</strong>  Do you think you and/or your research would benefit from attending this symposium? Then yes! Specific details on the topics covered are provided on the homepage.
            </p>
            <p class="text">
              <strong>Am I early career?</strong> Are you currently studying a research degree or are within 10 years of having completed your PhD (excluding career breaks)? Then yes!
            </p>
            <p class="text">
              <strong>Can I attend virtually?</strong> The point of this meeting is to build community, so we strongly encourage in-person attendance. That said, we want those who cannot attend in Oxford to be visible to the broader community. So virtual registrants are invited to provide an A3 poster introducing their research which will be shown at the meeting. Interactive virtual participation however is unlikely to be possible.
            </p>
            <p class="text">
              <strong>What will it cost?</strong> Registration is £80, it will cover all your meals for the duration of the event. That's a dinner and two lunches, the second of which will be possible to take away with you on the train if needed. Registration will open by mid-March. 
            </p>
